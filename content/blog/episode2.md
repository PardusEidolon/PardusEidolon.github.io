Over the past couple weeks I have been dipping my fingers into the unreal engine documentation and community materials associated with it. One of the keen interests that caught my eye with this is the fact that Epic Games (The Company that developed and created the engine for free) had bought a company called Quixel which do photographic materials and assets alongside an advanced material mixing tool. This library of assets which is constantly evolving, became free and available to Unreal Engine users for free. Having had a long eye on this for quite some time (about 5 years) I was never able to justify a standalone license for personal use as it was just a ‘want’ more than it was a need. I have always wanted to play around with the vast mix of materials and create amazing worlds in some type or form. Let the imagination run wild and free. Having gone back and forth between working on life and 3D design tools I have always found myself wanting to get into environment design but have always failed in the past by either giving up or just not having enough time.


These past few days looking around and understanding the tools necessary to build a believable world is getting me to a point where I can finally achieve that goal and branch out beyond my creative freedom.

Be sure to check out Quixel and their scans to see the uncompromising level of detail in their assets.
