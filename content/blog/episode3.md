After many tutorials and many failed attempts at trying to accomplish a successful shader I think I managed to get somewhere without avail. It may not look like much, but it’s honest work. All I’ve done is create a very basic scene using 3D assets and surfaces from the quixel suite, a very simple landscape layer blend with some painted foliage downloaded from the epic games marketplace. This is the first step in my understanding of getting a handle of being able to reach creative freedom with this tool, It also is one of many from which I have skipped a small pebble across shallow water.

The end goal is to create a game in the end run. My first trek of this journey is to create a photorealistic playable environment taking advantage of the power of the unreal engine.

Praise free stuff!
