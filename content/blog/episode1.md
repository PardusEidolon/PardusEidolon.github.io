Well It's about time that this got done. Im typing this from a typewriter, no not a real typewriter that would be silly, but rather on an over the top typing simulator. I’m not really good at this and if it were me in the second world war filing papers and writing letters, I don't think  I would make a very good computer.

But alas modern day computing and software advancements beyond the comprehension of the everyday man I' m also wanting to announce the first blog post on my brand new site. I'm still a little new to this game, but the time it takes to get from where I was to where I am now.

 Where were we right? Yes “the blog" it's taken me at least 3-4 months to get this far. I think with the knowledge  coming and the resources coming slowly together in my mind is a big step forward from where I was in the past before all this happened.

We still have a long road to go before this site is spick and span. A mobile deployment still has to created so it doesn't come out stupid on the everyyday smart phpne browser. (or maybe I should just make a portfolio app. Also current review of typewriters so far is it makes me glad I wasn't born under a rock) Performance updates and optimizations still need to be implemented Feel to look at the original pdf of this document to reveal just how bad I would do if a 50's newspaper company decided to hire me to write about opinion pieces.
