Having been a fan of the First We Feast Hot Ones series I thought it would be a good idea to order their infamous sauces which were eaten on the show. Having been prepared for this moment since the shows creation I decided to hold onto my butt and take a deep breath and eat some of the spiciest sauces known to mankind.

During the lockdown peroid I wanted to combine cooking and video into a story. This also in turn was me experimenting with the power of my camera and its colour profiles, going further with foley and implimenting scenic realism.
