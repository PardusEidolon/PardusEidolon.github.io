# About Me

Film and music is in my blood it has been since I first picked up a camera and played the first notes on a piano. Growing up surrounded by technology allowed me to latch on to new concepts and
techniques at an early age.

Today my convictions are as strong as they have ever been as Iâ€™m constantly striving to improve myself and spread the wonder that is beautiful. I currently finished studying my Bachelor of commercial music degree
from the Massey University of Wellington New Zealand. My degree taught me not just technical skills but a
greater understanding of the process of design of music as a whole. In my area of study I focused my efforts on Software engineering, Programming, Hardware & Software Design.

Over the years as a musician I have been in multiple teams on projects of varying disciplines to achieve high degrees of success. As a Engineer I have developed the need to have clearly defined convictions andvision to steer and help my fellow team members.I have refined skill sets in a number of applications including Visual Studio and Adobe Photoshop and After Effects, Autodesk 3ds Max and Pro Tools to help
communicate and realise my ideas.
