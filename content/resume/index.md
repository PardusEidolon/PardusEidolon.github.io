# About Me

Film and music is in my blood it has been since I first picked up a camera and played the first notes on a piano. Growing up surrounded by technology allowed me to latch on to new concepts and
techniques at an early age.

Today my convictions are as strong as they have ever been as I’m constantly striving to improve myself and spread the wonder that is beautiful. I currently finished studying my Bachelor of commercial music degree
from the Massey University of Wellington New Zealand. My degree taught me not just technical skills but a
greater understanding of the process of design of music as a whole. In my area of study I focused my efforts on Software engineering, Programming, Hardware & Software Design.

Over the years as a musician I have been in multiple teams on projects of varying disciplines to achieve high degrees of success. As a Engineer I have developed the need to have clearly defined convictions andvision to steer and help my fellow team members.I have refined skill sets in a number of applications including Visual Studio and Adobe Photoshop and After Effects, Autodesk 3ds Max and Pro Tools to help
communicate and realise my ideas.

{{< projects "Future of Music">}}
As part of my final year in university I decided to create a documentary film on the future of the music industry. The project’s aim was to create a film that explores the future evolution of music technology. The subject matter will cover what impact emerging digital technology might have on creative opportunities, production, and the various ways we can experience music. I wanted to be able to explain to my audience the importance of music beyond the three minute song. I want to demonstrate that many facets of music are at the cutting edge of technology and human culture, To show the generation that is paving the music technology industry today.
