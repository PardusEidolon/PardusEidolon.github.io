        <h1>About Me</h1>
        <p class="dark-grey">Film and music is in my blood it has been since I first picked up a camera and played the first notes on a
            piano.Growing up surrounded by technology allowed me to latch on to new concepts and techniques at an early
            age.
            <br>
            <br>
            Today my convictions are as strong as they have ever been as Iâ€™m constantly striving to improve myself and
            spread the wonder that is beautiful. I currently finished studying my Bachelor of commercial music degree
            from the Massey University of Wellington New Zealand. My degree taught me not just technical skills but a
            greater understanding of the process of design of music as a whole. In my area of study I focused my efforts
            on Software engineering, Programming, Hardware & Software Design.
            <br>
            <br>
            Over the years as a musician I have been in multiple teams on projects of varying disciplines to achieve
            high degrees of success. As a Engineer I have developed the need to have clearly defined convictions and
            vision to steer and help my fellow team members.I have refined skill sets in a number of applications
            including Visual Studio and Adobe Photoshop and After Effects, Autodesk 3ds Max and Pro Tools to help
            communicate and realise my ideas.</p>
